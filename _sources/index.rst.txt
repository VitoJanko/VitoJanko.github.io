Price list parser's documentation!
=============================================

This is the documentation for the Price-list Parser developed by Pareto. 
Both the project and the documentation are active works-in-progress. 

.. note::
   Abandon Hope All Ye Who Continue From Here

The main goal of this project is to take a PDF price list advertising cars,
and determine which cars are being sold, and for what price. This includes 
finding tables with the relevant data, understanding different table format, 
extracting different fields (engine, fuel, price, etc.) and matching this data 
to the database. 

An example of a price-list table with one cell highlighted:

Data found for the car represented by the highlighted cell: 

.. code-block:: console

   {
   'model_generations__model_generation__model__super_model__name': 'i30',
   'model_generations__model_generation__model__name': 'sw',
   'versions__version_name': 'Business',
   'engine_combinations__availability__price_gross': 28800.0,

   'engine_combinations__engine__name': 'crdi',
   'engine_combinations__transmission__type': 'manual',
   'engine_combinations__drivetrain__type': 'fwd',
   'engine_combinations__engine__power_main_kw': 84.58227,
   'engine_combinations__engine__fuel_type': 'diesel',

   'engine_combinations__engine__id': 1234,
   'engine_combinations__trafsnsmission__id': 42,
   'engine_combinations__drivetrain__id': 13,
   }

Structure
---------

In section :doc:`flow/index` we give an overview of the flow of data and the high level description 
of its parts, together with a graph of functions appearing in each part. 

In section :doc:`code/index` we provide description of each individual function, and some additional insights for 
particular files.

.. note::
   This project also covers other functionalities, such as parsing technical details, or finding equipment. But since 
   these parts are considered trade-secrets, they will not be documented. Just kidding, we are lazy.
