       :rtype: tuple[list[bool], int]



.. py:function:: stack_filled(tables, filled_list, filled_map_dict, col_number)

       Stacks tables together based on the metrics of filled columns, considering only tables with a specific number of filled columns.

       :param tables: List of tables represented as lists of lists.
       :type tables: list[list]
       :param filled_list: List of indices of tables with a specific number of filled columns.
