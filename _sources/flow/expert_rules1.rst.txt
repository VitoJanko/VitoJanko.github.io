Applying expert rules
=====================

Every combination of car brand and the country for which the PDF was written contains its own set of perks. And while we should usually celebrate 
diversity, this can represent additonal challenges for our parser. So throughout the entire parser we have sprinkled some additional rules and 
transformations that only apply to a specific brand-country combination. 

And some parts of the parser are meant to handly *only* such exceptions. They appear in three different 
parts of the table processing: before labeling, after labeling, and after splitting -- each case considered in its own subsection.
