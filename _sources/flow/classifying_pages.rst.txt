Classifying pages
===================

To minimize the expenses we process only pages
where we expect the price-list to appear. This is achieved using a k-Nearest Neighbor classifier, where 
we adopt the Bag-of-words method for feature creation.

Code output
===========

At the end we narrow-down the list of pages to only those that containin price-list information. There might be some other information available 
on the same page; this kind of data will be weeded out as the pipeline progresses. 

In this example we narrow down to a single page, containing the coveted pricelist as well as some information on the car equipment.
