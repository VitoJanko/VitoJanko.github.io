Labeling
========

The first step to understanding table contents is to analyze what data is contained in each cell. Is it fuel type? Horse-power, price? 
We use a Deep-learning approach here, taking the string in the cell -- as well as the strings in the surrounding cells -- as input
and spitting up the cell-type as the output. 

In the ongoing example, the labeled table would look like this:
