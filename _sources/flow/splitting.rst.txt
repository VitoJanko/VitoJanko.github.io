Splitting
==========

If you've been carefully inspecting the subsections for data examples, you might seen that our "standard table" contains entries such as 
"1.0 T-GDi 120 iBVM Hybrid 48V". If we truly want to have only one attribute in each column, we need to split this string and create additional
columns. In this case containing engine, transmission, power, and fuel type.

We do so, by searching for specific words or combination of words that appear in the Vehicle Editor database describing different attributes. 
We also employ some regex-es to find numeric values in some specific formats (ie. 80 kw).
