Transforming to the standard table form
=======================================

With cell labels in hand we are equipped to tackle the table structure! Are the versions (equipment level) on the top-right side of the table
and multiple prices in each row? The table is probably in the "wide" format. Are all the headers in the first column? Table is transposed!
Few rows empty in all but one fuel cell? The table is probably split by fuel type. And so on and on. 

After each such deduction we can transform the table a bit, and eventually end in what we call the "standard form". In this format each row 
represents one valid combination of car attributes, together with its price and each column represents one attribute (engine, transmission, etc).
